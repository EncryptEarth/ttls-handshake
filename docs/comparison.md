# TTLS vs Modern Protocols – Expanded Comparison

## Overview

This document compares Transformative TLS (TTLS) with several widely used cryptographic protocols including TLS 1.3, DTLS, Noise Protocol Framework, and emerging Post-Quantum TLS (PQ-TLS) variants. TTLS is a clean-slate cryptographic handshake and encryption protocol designed to eliminate metadata, infrastructure dependence, and third-party trust. It uses custom-built components optimized for privacy, statelessness, and post-quantum security.

## Summary

TTLS provides a next-generation cryptographic foundation distinct from TLS and its derivatives. While TLS 1.3 and PQ-TLS are optimized for traditional web traffic, TTLS is architected for high-security, embedded, and decentralized environments. It removes all trust dependencies, operates statelessly, and eliminates metadata entirely—features unmatched by other protocols in this comparison. Though not intended to replace TLS for high-volume HTTPS web applications, TTLS is ideal for privacy-focused apps, secure messaging, device communication, and blockchain-integrated systems.
